# Jimmy Lam's portfolio
This is a my first developer portfolio made using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). The design was made in [figma](https://www.figma.com/file/42h7nlOXdb1j5dAnuB0d1L/Portfolio-site-design?node-id=0%3A1) with inspiration from this [design](https://www.behance.net/gallery/63164537/Tura-UI-Design).
